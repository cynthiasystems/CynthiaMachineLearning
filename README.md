# 🚀 Cynthia Machine Learning 🌌

Welcome, cosmic coder, to the galactic core of Cynthia's Machine Learning adventures! Here, algorithms waltz across cosmic stages, neurons shimmer like distant stars, and amidst this splendor, the Cynthia Transformer radiates its brilliance. 🌠

## 🤖 Cynthia Transformer's Galactic Tour 🌟

Strap in for an interstellar voyage with our masterfully forged Transformer model, a beacon of Cynthia's relentless pursuit of stellar quality and groundbreaking novelties. Unlock the mysteries of attention galaxies and witness as NLP frontiers crumble like meteor dust! 💥

## 🚀 Dive into the World of Transformers with Cynthia! 🌌

Ever wondered how you could chat with aliens from another galaxy? While we can't guarantee extraterrestrial communication (yet 😉), our Cynthia Transformer lets you decode and translate sequences like a pro! Let's embark on this cosmic coding adventure together.

### 🚀 Prepping Your Spaceship (Setup)

First, let's define our inputs. Imagine these as the alien messages you're receiving and the replies you're sending back.

```python
encoder_input = tf.placeholder(np.int32, shape=[None, 5], name="encoder_input")
decoder_labels = tf.placeholder(np.int32, shape=[None, 6], name="decoder_labels")
```

### 🌌 Venturing into the Galaxy (Transformer Call)

Next, plug into the Cynthia Transformer! This is where the galactic translation magic happens. 🌠

```python
softmax, loss, accuracy = transformer(encoder_input,
                                      decoder_labels,
                                      encoder_vocab_size=6,
                                      decoder_vocab_size=10)
```

### 🛸 Deciphering Alien Messages (Sample Data)

Let's use some sample alien messages (and our human replies):

```python
# encoder (alien messages)
encoder_data = [[2, 3, 4, 0, 0],  # "Hello? 🛸"
               [5, 4, 3, 2, 0],  # "What planet? 🌍"
               [2, 3, 4, 3, 2]]  # "Want pizza? 🍕"

# decoder (our replies)
decoder_data = [[9, 8, 7, 3, 0, 0],  # "Hey there! 👋"
               [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3],  # "Earth. Wanna visit? 🚀"
               [9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0]]  # "Always! 🍕🎉"
```

### 🎉 Celebrate and Communicate!

Run your session, iterate, and watch as the alien-human conversation unfolds!

```python
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer().minimize(loss)

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

for i in range(200):
    result = sess.run(
        feed_dict={
            encoder_input: encoder_input_data,
            decoder_labels: decoder_input_data
        }, fetches=[optimizer, softmax, loss, accuracy])
    print(f"{i:<5} {result[2]} {result[3]}")

```

Remember, every coding journey is a story waiting to be told. Have fun with the Cynthia Transformer and may your codes always be cosmic! 🌠🛸👾
