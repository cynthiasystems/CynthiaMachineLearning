# 🤖 CynthiaMachineLearning 🌟

Welcome to the heart and soul of **Cynthia's Machine Learning** endeavors! Dive into a realm where algorithms dance,
neurons light up, and where the Cynthia Transformer truly shines. 🎉

## 🧠 Cynthia Transformer

Embark on a journey with our meticulously crafted Transformer model, a testament to our commitment to quality and
innovation. Harness the power of attention mechanisms and watch as NLP barriers get shattered!

## 🎉 Fun With The Cynthia Transformer!
Ever wondered how to play with the Cynthia Transformer? Well, you're in for a treat! 🎩✨

Let's take a whimsical journey through an example:

### 1️⃣ Setting the Stage
Let's define our encoder and decoder inputs. Think of these like magic runes that feed into our Transformer:

```python
# encoder - Our secret language! 🗝️
# ------------------------
# 0: padding (like an empty space in a treasure map!)
# 1: unknown (mysterious, right?)
encoder_input_data = [[2, 3, 4, 0, 0],
                      [5, 4, 3, 2, 0],
                      [2, 3, 4, 3, 2]]

# decoder - The magical decoder ring! 🌈
# -------------------------
# 0: padding
# 1: unknown
# 2: start of sequence (Let the magic begin!)
# 3: end of sequence (And... scene!)
decoder_input_data = [[9, 8, 7, 3, 0, 0],
                      [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 3],
                      [9, 8, 3, 0, 0, 0]]
```

### 2️⃣ Summoning The Magic
With our magical runes ready, let's invoke the power of the Transformer!

```python
optimizer = tf.train.AdamOptimizer().minimize(loss)

sess = tf.Session()
sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())

for i in range(200):
    result = sess.run(
        feed_dict={
            encoder_input: encoder_input_data,
            decoder_labels: decoder_input_data
        }, fetches=[optimizer, softmax, loss, accuracy])
    print(f"{i:<5} {result[2]} {result[3]}")

```

### 🎈 Ta-da!
And there you have it! With a sprinkle of magic (and some serious math under the hood!), you've just embarked on a delightful journey with the Cynthia Transformer.
